You are working as a data analyst for the ‘Foundational Trust of Medicine’ and have been tasked with helping to analyse the following dataset.

The foundational trust receive calls every second daily.

Patients ring 555 for medical emergencies requiring an ambulance responder.

A years’ worth of data has been taken and the trust are trying to analyse the current process as well as understand how the service is currently operating and if there are any opportunities for improvement or causes for concern.

The process is currently outlined below:

A patient calls 555---->A member of staff will receive the call (Time Recorded) and assign a despatch code----->once the despatch code has been assigned---->The Ambulance will then leave the station (Time Recorded) -----> The Ambulance will then arrive at the patients house (Time Recorded) -----> The Ambulance will then arrive at the Hospital (Time Recorded)------> Then there is one final Timestamp for when the job is complete.

The data should be pretty self-explanatory and should be ripe for us to devour in report development. This is a completely random and anonymised data set for obvious reasons. However this shouldn’t detract from us going through the process of and really creating a compelling story and report.



Food For Thought

No of calls
Time between time of call and ambulance departure.
Time taken for ambulance to arrive to patient.
Time taken from patient house to hospital.
No of jobs between specific period i.e over lunch times 12:00-14:00
Does the despatch code affect the timings?
Does the call handler have any impact?
Do certain hospitals have issues in particular aspect
What does the data say based upon the ambulance station?
Does patient Sex affect handover times?
Objectives:
Utilize the 4 pillars of development using best practices: data transformation, data modeling, DAX calculations and reporting and visualization
Work with an anonymized data on medical emergency services
Create an analysis of the emergency process and services to drive improvement 
Develop a compelling report using visualization tools and techniques that will communicate the information dynamically
